# `mini-mail-dev`

![Screenshot](/screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Screnshot")

A alternative take on a development testing email server.

## Why

Something something reinventing the wheel :^)

But besides the fun of reinventing the wheel I do have some reasons for making this.
I used maildev before this and I have some annoyances with it. It's an awesome project and has improved my life, but after using it for many years I have also noticed it's not without its flaws. So here is `mini-mail-dev`, my take on a mail development server and with fixes for my maildev problems.

Here are things this project aims to improve / do different compared to maildev:

- Attachments not hidden behind a button
- By default a fixed max amount of emails and when exceeded old emails are removed. _(So you can safely deploy this on a server without much storage or cpu as the server does not have to store a shitload of emails when sending a shitload of emails on a staging server hehe)_
- Different server side language. _Mail dev has a tendency to break when running it on a server and sending more than the "average" amound of mails (my experience is at around 5.000 emails). By applying the above and using a language that is better suited for these kinds of things I can deploy this on every potato in the world._
